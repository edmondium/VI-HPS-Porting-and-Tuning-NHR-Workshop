# Introduction

The NPB folder contains three benchmarks from the NAS Parallel Benchmark suite.
The codes are already adapted to contain one marked code region using LIKWID's MarkerAPI.

Benchmarks
- bt-mz
- sp-mz
- lu-mz

# Compilation

$ source /home/hpc/vihps-tw44/setup.sh
$ tar -xj NPB.tar.bz2
$ cd NPB
$ make <benchmark> CLASS=<class> NPROCS=<number_of_MPI_processes>

The binary will be located in the bin.likwid folder.

# Running

Since all the benchmarks are MPI based, you have to use likwid-mpirun to run them.
likwid-mpirun is a wrapper for the different MPI starter mechanisms.

## Run the application pinned to individual cores (MPI-only)

$ likwid-mpirun -np <number_of_MPI_processes> <binary>

## Run the application pinned to individual cores in a hybrid setup

$ likwid-mpirun -np <number_of_MPI_processes> -t <number_of_OMP_threads> <binary>

## Run the application, pin it and measure hardware performance events for the whole application run

$ likwid-mpirun -np <mpi_procs> -t <omp_procs> -g <eventset> <binary>

For available eventsets, see 'likwid-perfctr -a' on a target node

## After instrumentation, run the application, pin it and measure hardware performance events for a code region

$ likwid-mpirun -np <mpi_procs> -t <omp_procs> -g <eventset> -m <binary>
